The following is the first version of a Loot Generator for the Table top RPG 'Dungeons and Dragons' Written in JS using a Mix of Git-bash, NODE.js, and VSC*
*(for Quality of Life Changes)
The original Copy was a 1k+ line Document which was then augmented into three seperate modules for the following purposes:
  1.diceroll.js
    >The Storing of a Number Generator Categorized by the type of Dice available in the game, (d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, etc.) to Simulate the Rolls in an accurate 
    manner.
  2.arrays.js
    >The Generator Requires a large system of arrays that took up most of the document causing clutter, as such they were moved into their own file to provide better
    readability
  3.Generator.js
    >The Generator itself, made mostly of Nested Objects, and the use of Switch Keyboards to Lean away from the usage of if...else statments. It includes the following
    features:
      >Money Drops
      >Art Drops
      >Gem Drops
      >Further within the Next Update.
